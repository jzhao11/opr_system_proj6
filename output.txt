Consumer and Producer Arrays Match!
Total Runtime: 30 secs



Annotation:
At the beginning, current time is printed as the start of timer. The next several lines list related parameters that are read from command line arguments. After the initialization by using these parameters, producer and consumer threads are created, with each of them calling the thread function.

In producer thread function, every time an item (integer) is produced and enqueued to the bounded buffer, information is printed on terminal. The prompt has the format "n was produced by prodQucer-> tid", where n refers to the unique integer and tid refers to the index of thread. Similarly, the consumer thread function shows "n wasconsumed by consumer-> tid" after an integer is dequeued from the buffer and consumed. When a thread joins the main process, there is a notification "Producer (or Consumer) Thread Joined: tid". Then current time is printed again as the end of timer, meaning that the main process has completed.

For each integer enqueued to the buffer and dequeued from the buffer, it is also stored in producer array and consumer array, respectively. Finally, the elements in these two arrays are listed for comparison. If matching, there should be a prompt "Consumer and Producer Arrays Match!", as shown above. It demonstrates that the producers and consumers are working as expected, with correct execution sequence.
